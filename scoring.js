// Server-authoritative scoring.
// Flutter client displays whatever the server sends — no client calculation.

// Formula:
//   base:         100 points for a correct answer
//   speed bonus:  up to 50 points — linear decay over question timer
//   streak bonus: 10 points per streak level, capped at 50.
//                 streak is the count BEFORE this answer is added.
//                 So: 1st correct = 0 bonus, 2nd consecutive = +10, 3rd = +20, etc.
//                 To award bonus from the 1st correct answer, increment streak before calling.
